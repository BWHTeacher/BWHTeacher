- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BWHTeacher
- ðŸ‘€ I have been trying to learn basic coding and electronics to teach at a 4th - 8th grade level.
- 
-       I had started with a Pi Pico and made an RC turtle with a group of students. I am now working with Arduino esp32's and looking
-     at their Uno boards. I am currently trying to make an action figure sized arcade, using said esp32 wroom, for practice. The hope is to scale it into reasonably 
-     priced handhelds emulator for them to build. I am not really that good at this, but there is a lot of interest from my students. I want to give them the base
-     skills and confidence to explore intrests that seem out of reach.
